    Add a prompt to the beginning of the game to ask if they want easy, medium or hard. (let difficulty = prompt("What's it gonna be punk? Easy? Medium? or Hard?") 
    If they chose hard - say "Ooh tricky" if ("Hard" === difficulty) {
        console.log("Ooooh tricky")
    }
    Add other comments for easy & medium
    Add another comment if they don't type easy, medium or hard (example "you eedjut")
    Once they've guessed tell them if their guess is too high or too low
    If they type easy - they get 5 guesses
    If they type medium - they get 3 guesses
    If they type hard - 8 guesses and they get a random number between 0-100
